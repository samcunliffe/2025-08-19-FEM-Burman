# What? Who?

- RSE mentoring for two postdocs in Erik Burman's research group:
  [Janosch Preuáºž](https://www.mps.mpg.de/7387373/pm-20220516-promotionspreis-fuer-janosch-preuss) | [Deepika Garg](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Deepika-Garg-9).
- Erik is the _Chair of Computational Mathematics_ and an expert on **Finite Element Methods**.
  - Insofar as you should trust h-index, his is a big number.

* He's also really friendly.

# Finite element method in six bullets

- Solving equations in continuous space or on a continuous surface is hard (/impossible).
- So don't do that.
- Descritise.
- Define a mesh.
- Solve the equations on the mesh.
- Combine to get a global model.

---

# The Burkman group research

Is it possible to do FEM without boundary conditions?

- Deepika's project: solving fluid dynamics (Navier-Stokes) problems with unknown boundary conditions (or other missing data).
- Janosch's project: solving the wave equation for non-linear problems.

Somewhat common code to do both of these things.

# What FEM is _actually_ doing

- Linear systems of equations.
- Matrix multiplications.

# _Actual_ toolstack

- [FEniCSx](https://docs.fenicsproject.org/), [Dolfinx](https://docs.fenicsproject.org/dolfinx/v0.9.0/python/) - FEM platform;
- [pyPardiso](https://github.com/haasad/PyPardiso) - sparse solvers;
- [PETSc](https://petsc.org/release/petsc4py/) - parallel solvers;
- [gmsh.py](https://gmsh.info) - meshing with Python API;
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/); [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

# Initial period of mentoring

## Anastasis, Jamie

- Long-running menotring of two postdocs on best practices.
- Bar set at: version control, reproducible results in Jupyter, public code for public papers.
  - Mostly confidence-building and guidance through `git`, virtual environment workflows.
  - Postdocs attended Software Carpentries.
- A _lot_ of pausing (during the time when we were at very high capacity).

---

# Matt (Graham) takes over

## May 2023

- Matt supports postdocs and gently pushes them to abstract things into a reusable library (common helper functions, plotting).
- We realise there's more hours than we could use for mentoring.
- Suggest to actively take postdoc code, move it into a package.
- Matt realises he's needed by Thanzi la Onse.

---

# Sam takes over...

## September 2023

# But things go south

> Suggest to actively take postdoc code, move it into a package.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

* The way the collaborations team meausres indirects changes midway.
  - At end of the month, indirects come in a chunk.
* Both team members have unusually high indirects. Burn through hours with little/no delivery.
* Staff and family illness means we pause.
  - In that time, postdoc code advances _a lot_.
* Project goes ðŸ”´ red and paused for a few months.

# Code woes

- Agreed on MIT with the postdocs.
- We learned some code was copied from another library: GPL2!

* Re-implemented offending file in "the FEniCSx way".
  - Ended up as much fewer lines an nicer code.

# ðŸŸ¢ Back to green

## May 2024

![](assets/dms-matt-jonc.png)

- In the end, we're overtaken by our postdoc's code development pace.
- Postdocs get publications ðŸŽ‰.
- Very conveniently, we now hire Matt Scroggs.
  - Previous develioper/contributor to FEniCSx.
  - Remaining hours transferred to a mini-project.
  - Erik is very happy with this.

---

# Lessons learned

- Double-check code origin with the postdocs before slapping your preferred license.
- Make sure any deliverable commitment keeps up with the pace of research team's development.
- Long-running hour-per-week mentoring projects suffer when collaborations team gets high capacity load.
  - "Flexible working" and "dynamic staffing" are great, so is continuity and building domain-expertise.
  - It might actually be possible that a PI can be _too_ nice.
- (**Sam Cunliffe**) Uncomfortable with the "new" way of handling time-tracking.
